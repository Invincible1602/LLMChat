# services/__init__.py
# This file can be empty or can selectively import components from other service modules.
# For this project's structure, it's best to keep it clean and remove old crawl service imports.

# Example of selective imports if needed, otherwise keep it empty:
# from .chat_service import ChatService
# from .query_service import QueryService
# from .pdf_service import PDFService
# from .intent_detection_service import IntentDetectionService

# Ensure no 'from .crawl_service import ...' lines are present.
